## Rust on ESP Community

This organization is home to a number of community projects enabling the use of the [Rust programming language] on various SoCs and modules produced by [Espressif Systems].

If you are just getting started with writing Rust for ESP devices, please first read [The Rust on ESP book].

For a curated list of resouces for development including tools and projects, see [Awesome ESP Rust].
